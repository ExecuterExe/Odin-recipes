    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The burger from the SpongeBob cartoon has become so iconic that only lazy people <br>
        have not tried to make it. Moreover, it is still on the children's menu in <br>
        some restaurants. Cooking a crab burger is not difficult at all. <br>
        You can do it for sure.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A small round bun made of wheat flour - 1</li>
        <li>Pork and beef cutlet - 1</li>
        <li>Cheese in slices - 1</li>
        <li>Tomato - 1</li>
        <li>Pickled cucumber - 1</li>
        <li>Any kind of lettuce leaves and a few rings of sweet onions - 1</li>
        <li>Ketchup and mustard - 1</li>
        <li>Frying oil - 1</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cooking steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add spices, salt and onions to the minced meat. Grate it on a grater so that the latter is less
            tangible<br>
            Mix the mass with your hands and form it into a cutlet, <br>
            the diameter of which coincides with the diameter of a bun</li>
        <li>Fry the meat "tortilla" on both sides for a few minutes each. <br>
            It is important that the meat is completely cooked inside</li>
        <li>Cut the bun in half. Put a thin layer of ketchup mixed with mustard <br>
            on the bottom of the bun. Also smear the sauce on top of the bun</li>
        <li>Place lettuce, small slices of cucumber and tomato, and rings of onion on the dressing.</li>
        <li>Cover everything with a slab of cheese and the other half of the bun</li>
    </ol>
